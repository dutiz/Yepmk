                Youth Empowerment Platform (YEP) is a youth-orientated non-governmental
                organization, located in Gostivar.<br>
                <br>
                YEP was founded on April 24, 2015 by a group of enthusiastic young people who believe in amplifying the
                voices of young people and serving their communities. </p>

            <p class="my-6 font-medium text-base">The Youth Empowerment Platform has been active for four years, and
                during this time, more than 50 activists have supported the mission and goals. Currently, there are nine
                different programs/projects our members participate in or lead. These programs include the following:
                Say It, TechUp, Film It, YEP Talks, My Future, Techathon, Gostronic, and My City, My Pride. Through
                these programs, YEP has supported over 450 young people by assisting them with obtaining various
                technical skills, providing mentorship, and fostering their activism. In addition to the regularly
                scheduled projects, YEP holds informal activities — like movie nights or group hikes — for the members.
                During the academic year 2018-2019, approximately 200 people from Gostivar have attended these events.
                Not only are these events a way for members to develop their skills and knowledge, but they also serve
                as a networking event.

                    YEP’s active members consist of more than 30 youth, mainly between the ages of 14 and 18. There are
                    also some more experienced members, between the ages of 23 and 29. Our members are passionate about
                    serving their communities, learning from each other, and building their experiences. While the
                    president is available to guide and mentor YEP members, it’s the members who take the lead on
                    projects. Members meet once a week to discuss the projects they’d like to design and implement, and
                    the president is there to facilitate the meetings and provide any support they may need. The task of
                    the president is to act as a moderator during the meeting, and never as a lawgiver. This ensures
                    that the members are actively involved during the discussions at the meetings.
